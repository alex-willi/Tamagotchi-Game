User Story:
 
To start the user should see a start button. When clicked it should prompt the user to name their Tomigotchi
 
After naming the pet, the user should see a Tomagotchi pet in the middle of the screen that displays how it is feeling.
 
There should be 3 values of sleep, happy and hungry above the pet for the user to monitor.
 
Three buttons below the pet that correspond with the above values.
 
When buttons are clicked the pet values should lower and make the pet happier. This simulates interaction with the pet.
 
When the pet has no interaction the values go up signifying the level of unhappiness the pet is feeling.
 
If one of the three levels reaches a value of 10. the pet dies.

When the pet dies, the game displays that you are a bad pet owner.
